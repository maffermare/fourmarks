            Reflect on the holiness of the Church through the sacraments.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Write a heartfelt, illustrated "thank you" story about a meaningful experience with the sacraments.</li>
            <li>If no such experience has occurred, reflect on grace or forgiveness and create a story based on these themes.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Use your creativity to make this story uplifting and respectful. This is an opportunity to think deeply about how sacraments enrich our lives and connect us to God.
